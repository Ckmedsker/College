            <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
            <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
            <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the
            ground. Each yurt has<br> canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that
            can be opened, and a private deck.</p>
            <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
            <p>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with
            down quilt, comfy <br>couch, dining table and chairs, mini-fridge,
            microwave, and coffee maker. Your <br>luxury camping experience includes
            a sink with hot and cold running water. <br>Shower and restroom
            facilities are located in the lodge.</p>
            <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
            <p>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
            changing <br>weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to
            bring a <br>flashlight and a sense of adventure!</p>
